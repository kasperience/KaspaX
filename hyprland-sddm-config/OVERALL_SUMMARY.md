# Kaspa Linux Hyprland+SDDM Setup - Final Summary

## Overview

We have successfully completed the task of removing all Omarchy references from the Kaspa Linux project and creating a clean, lean Hyprland+SDDM setup. This setup focuses on standard Linux tools rather than Omarchy-specific applications, providing users with a minimal, customizable environment.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Removed All Omarchy References
✅ Updated all main project files to use "Kaspa Linux" instead of "Omarchy"
✅ Updated all configuration files to use correct paths and service names
✅ Updated all installation scripts to remove Omarchy-specific commands
✅ Verified that no active files contain references to "Omarchy"

### 2. Created Clean Hyprland+SDDM Setup
✅ Created complete directory structure with organized configuration files
✅ Implemented modular configuration approach for easy customization
✅ Added all necessary configuration files for a functional desktop environment:
   - Hyprland (window manager)
   - Waybar (status bar)
   - Mako (notification daemon)
   - SwayOSD (on-screen display)
   - SDDM (display manager)
   - Rofi (application launcher)
   - Swaylock (screen locker)
   - Clipman (clipboard manager)

### 3. Customized Keybindings for Lean Setup
✅ Removed all Omarchy-specific applications from keybindings
✅ Added standard Linux tools:
   - Rofi for application launching
   - Swaylock for screen locking
   - Clipman for clipboard management
   - Grim/Slurp for screenshots
   - Wf-recorder for screen recording
✅ Added useful system actions:
   - Lock screen/session
   - Suspend/Hibernate/Power off/Reboot
   - Notification controls

### 4. Created Installation Scripts
✅ Main installation script that installs all required packages
✅ Script to build and install Kaspa applications
✅ Scripts copy all configuration files to the correct locations

### 5. Created Utility Scripts
✅ Script to switch between clean and legacy setups
✅ Verification scripts to ensure no Omarchy references remain

### 6. Created Comprehensive Documentation
✅ README with overview and installation instructions
✅ INSTALL guide with detailed steps
✅ Additional customization documentation
✅ Summary of all changes made
✅ Final verification report
