# Gestures configuration was removed in Hyprland v0.50.
# The former `gestures { workspace_swipe = â€¦ }` group no longer exists
# and will cause a config error if left enabled. If you need swipe
# gestures, refer to the Hyprland documentation for plugin-based or
# external gesture solutions compatible with your version.
#
# Example (pre-0.50, now deprecated):
# gestures {
#     workspace_swipe = false
# }
