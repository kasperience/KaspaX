# Vision for Kaspa Linux

## Core Philosophy

*   **Decentralization:** The system should prioritize and natively support decentralized technologies. All core applications should function on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis where possible.
*   **User Sovereignty:** Users should have ultimate control over their data, identity, and interactions. The system will avoid centralized services that compromise user privacy and ownership.
*   **Kaspa Ecosystem:** The OS is purpose-built to be a premier platform for developing and using applications within the Kaspa ecosystem.

## Key Technologies

*   **Operating System Base:** Arch Linux + Hyprland
*   **Core Application Framework:** kdapp (Rust-based P2P framework)
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Native integration with the Kaspa network for identity, data, and transactions.

## Core Integrated Applications

*   **kaspa-auth:** A decentralized identity and authentication service running as a system daemon.
*   **kdapp-wallet:** A persistent, background wallet service for managing Kaspa assets and application transactions.
*   **comment-it / comment-board:** Natively integrated commenting and discussion platforms.

## Future Application Suite (Brainstorm)

*   **kMessenger:** Secure, P2P messaging application.
*   **kDrive:** Decentralized, P2P file storage and sharing.
*   **kPages:** A decentralized micro-blogging or social feed platform.
*   **kMeet:** P2P video and voice conferencing.
*   **kPoker:** Decentralized, P2P poker game.
